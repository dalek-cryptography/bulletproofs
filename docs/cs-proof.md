Constraint System Proofs
========================

A **constraint system** is a system that defines arithmetic constraints over a set of variables.
The proof system allows a **verifier** to specify the constraints, for which a **prover** is asked to generate a valid proof.
The resulting proof is zero-knowledge: the constraints are known to both the prover and the verifier, but the variables remain secret.

The constraint system we use is specifically a **rank-1 quadratic constraint system** or **R1CS**.
Such system allows expressing linear constraints over individual variables as well as multiplications of these variables.

The proving system uses efficient [inner product protocol](../inner_product_proof/index.html)
by expressing all the constraints in terms of a single inner product.
The following notes describe in detail how this is accomplished.

Notation
--------

Dimensions of vectors:

* \\(m\\) — number of secret values \\({\mathbf{v}}\\),
* \\(n\\) — number of variable multiplication gates represented by \\(\mathbf{a}\_L, \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{a}\_O\\),
* \\(q\\) — number of linear constraints represented by \\(\mathbf{W}\_L, \mathbf{W}\_R, \mathbf{W}\_O, \mathbf{W}\_V\\).

In the [Bulletproofs paper][bp_website], matrices are labeled as \\(\mathbf{W}\_L, \mathbf{W}\_R, \mathbf{W}\_O, \mathbf{W}\_V\\). We will keep this notation, but will note to readers not to confuse the \\(\mathbf{W}\_{L,R,O,V}\\) notation for being a vector of points.

We will use the notation described in the [`notation`](../notes/index.html#notation) section of the notes. In addition, we rename two more variables from the paper for better consistency with the rest of the notation:
\\[
\begin{aligned}
    \beta         &\xrightarrow{} \tilde{o} \\\\
	Q             &\xrightarrow{} q \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

Constraint system
-----------------

The constraint system consists of two sets of constraints: [multiplication gates](#multiplication-gates) and [linear constraints](#linear-constraints) in terms of the [variables](#variables).

### Variables

There are two kinds of variables in the constraint system:

1. \\(m\\) **high-level** variables, the input secrets \\(\mathbf{v}\\),
2. \\(n\\) **low-level** variables, the internal inputs and outputs of the [multiplication gates](#multiplication-gates): \\(\mathbf{a}\_L, \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{a}\_O\\).

### Multiplication gates

Each multiplication gate takes two input variables and multiplies them to get an output.
That relation for all multiplication gates is represented by \\(n\\) constraints:

\\[
\mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R = \mathbf{a}\_O,
\\]
where:
* \\(\mathbf{a}\_L\\) is the vector of the first input to each gate,
* \\(\mathbf{a}\_R\\) is the vector of the second input to each gate,
* \\(\mathbf{a}\_O\\) is the vector of multiplication results.

### Linear constraints

Linear constraints are expressed using a vector of \\(q\\) equations that use linear combinations of the [variables](#variables):

\\[
\mathbf{W}\_L \cdot \mathbf{a}\_L +
\mathbf{W}\_R \cdot \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{W}\_O \cdot \mathbf{a}\_O =
\mathbf{W}\_V \cdot \mathbf{v} +
\mathbf{c},
\\]
where:

* \\(\mathbf{W}\_L, \mathbf{W}\_R, \mathbf{W}\_O\\) are weights applied to the respective inputs and outputs of the [multiplication gates](#multiplication-gates) (low-level [variables](#variables)),
* \\(\mathbf{W}\_V\\) are weights applied to the high-level [variables](#variables) \\(\mathbf{v}\\),
* \\(\mathbf{c}\\) is a vector of constant terms used in the linear constraints.


### Building constraints

Bulletproofs framework allows building constraint systems _on the fly_, without a trusted setup.
This allows instantiating constraints from a _family of constraint systems_ parametrized by
public values and commitments to the secret inputs.
As a result, the instantiation can be thought of as a _challenge_ generated by a verifier to a prover.

The prover starts out by committing to its secret inputs \\(\mathbf{v}\\)
and obtaining \\(m\\) _variables_ representing these inputs.

Then, the prover performs a combination of the following operations to generate the constraints:

1. **Allocate a multiplier:** a new [multiplication gate](#multiplication-gates) is added, represented by three [low-level variables](#variables) \\(a_L, a_R, a_O\\), for left input, right input and output value respectively.
2. **Add a constraint:** a [linear combination](#linear-constraints) of any number of [variables](#variables) is encoded into appropriate positions in matrices \\(\mathbf{W}\_L, \mathbf{W}\_R, \mathbf{W}\_O, \mathbf{W}\_V\\) and a vector of constants \\(\mathbf{c}\\).
3. **Request a challenge scalar:** a random scalar returned in response to committed [high-level variables](#variables).


### Gadgets

Gadgets are buildings blocks of a constraint system that map to some functions in a higher-level protocol.
Gadgets receive some [variables](#variables) as inputs, may [allocate more variables](#building-constraints) for internal use,
and produce constrains involving all these variables.

Examples:
* a **shuffle gadget** creates constraints that prove that two sets of variables are equal up to a permutation;
* a **range proof gadget** checks that a given value is composed of a specific number of bits.


### Uncommitted variables

Often a [gadget](#gadgets) needs a variable to connect with another gadget,
or to implement its internal logic, without requiring a distinct [high-level variable](#variables) commitment \\(V\_i\\) for it.
Such **uncommitted variables** are created from left and right variables \\(a\_L, a\_R\\) of additional multiplication gates.
Output variables \\(a\_O\\) are not used for this purpose because
they are implicitly constrained by a [multiplication gate](#multiplication-gates)
and cannot be used as independent uncommitted variables.

**Important:** uncommitted variables have their name due to lack of the individual commitments \\(V\_i\\),
but they are still committed collectively with all [low-level variables](#variables)
using a single vector Pedersen commitment \\(A\_I\\) as required by the underlying proof protocol.
The distinction is important when [building constraints](#building-constraints) using [challenges](#gadget-as-a-challenge),
which are bound only to the high-level variables, but not to the low-level variables (hence, “uncommitted”).


### Gadget as a challenge

Intermediate challenge scalars can be used to construct [gadgets](#gadgets) more efficiently.

For example, a shuffle gadgets (“proof of permutation”) can be done by proving equality of
two polynomials sampled at a challenge point, where roots of each polynomial
represent secret values of the corresponding side of a permutation:

\\[
 \\{a,b\\} = \\{c,d\\}  \iff  (a-x)\cdot(b-x) = (c-x)\cdot(d-x),
\\] where \\(x\\) is a random challenge, sampled after all values \\(a,b,c,d\\) are committed.

Making a proof of permutation using a static gadget (without challenge values) may require
building a [sorting network][sorting_network] that would use significantly more multiplication gates.

**Important:** since challenges in the linear constraints are bound only to [high-level variables](#variables),
using them to implement high-level protocols requires proving the soundness of the system as a _whole_.
Individual gadgets can be proven to be sound only when they do not use such challenges.
This caveat does not apply to the challenges used to implement the underlying proof system (\\(y, z, x, w\\)),
as these are produced after all variables (including low-level ones) are committed.

### Representation of constraints

The matrices \\(\mathbf{W}\_L, \mathbf{W}\_R, \mathbf{W}\_O, \mathbf{W}\_V\\) are typically very sparse
because most constraints apply only to a few variables. As a result, constraints are represented as short lists
of pairs \\((i, w)\\) where \\(i\\) is an index of a variable, and \\(w\\) is its (non-zero) weight.

Multiplication of a matrix by a vector is implemented via multiplication of each weight \\(w\\) by 
a scalar in the vector at a corresponding index \\(i\\). This way, all zero-weight terms are automatically skipped.


Combining statements using challenge variables
----------------------------------------------

We can rewrite the statement about multiplication gates into an inner product equation, using the challenge variable \\(y\\).
We can do this for a random challenge \\(y\\) because \\({\mathbf{b}} = {\mathbf{0}}\\) if and only
if[^1] \\({\langle {\mathbf{b}}, {\mathbf{y}}^{n} \rangle} = 0\\). The equation \\(\mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R = \mathbf{a}\_O\\) becomes:

\\[
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R - \mathbf{a}\_O ,
\mathbf{y}^n \rangle = 0
\\]

We can rewrite the statement about the linear constraints into an inner product equation, using the challenge variable \\(z\\).
We can do this for a random challenge \\(z\\), for the same reason as above. The equation
\\(
\mathbf{W}\_L \cdot \mathbf{a}\_L +
\mathbf{W}\_R \cdot \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{W}\_O \cdot \mathbf{a}\_O =
\mathbf{W}\_V \cdot \mathbf{v} +
\mathbf{c}
\\) 
becomes:

\\[
\langle z \mathbf{z}^q,
\mathbf{W}\_L \cdot \mathbf{a}\_L +
\mathbf{W}\_R \cdot \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{W}\_O \cdot \mathbf{a}\_O -
\mathbf{W}\_V \cdot \mathbf{v} -
\mathbf{c}
\rangle = 0
\\]

We can combine these two inner product equations, since they are offset by different multiples of challenge variable \\(z\\).
The statement about multiplication gates is multiplied by \\(z^0\\), while the statements about addition and scalar multiplication gates
are multiplied by a powers of \\(z\\) between \\(z^1\\) and \\(z^q\\). Combining the two equations gives us:

\\[
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R - \mathbf{a}\_O ,
\mathbf{y}^n \rangle +
\langle z \mathbf{z}^q, 
\mathbf{W}\_L \cdot \mathbf{a}\_L +
\mathbf{W}\_R \cdot \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{W}\_O \cdot \mathbf{a}\_O -
\mathbf{W}\_V \cdot \mathbf{v} -
\mathbf{c}
\rangle = 0
\\]

Before we proceed, we factor out “flattened constraints” from the terms that involve weight matrices:

\\[
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R - \mathbf{a}\_O ,
\mathbf{y}^n \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{a}\_L \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_O, \mathbf{a}\_O \rangle -
\langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v}    \rangle - w\_c = 0
\\]
\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w}\_L &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_L, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_R &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_R, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_O &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_O, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_V &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_V, \\\\
w\_c          &= \langle z \mathbf{z}^q, \mathbf{c} \rangle, \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]
where each of \\(\mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_O\\) has length \\(n\\) and \\(\mathbf{w}\_V\\) has length \\(m\\).

[^1]: This is because the polynomial in terms of \\(y\\) is zero at every point
if and only if every term of it is zero. The verifier is going to sample
a random \\(y\\) after the prover commits to all the values forming the terms of
that polynomial, making the probability that the prover cheated negligible.
This trick allows implementing logical `AND` with any number of terms.

Rearranging into a single inner product statement
-------------------------------------------------

We want to work towards expressing the constraints in terms of a single inner product,
so that we can use the [inner product argument](../notes/index.html#inner-product-proof)
to represent it in a more compact and efficient-to-verify form. 
To do that we will rearrange the above equation so that terms
involving \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}\\) and \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{O}\\) appear only on the left-hand side, terms
involving \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\) appear only on the right-hand side, and
non-secret terms (which the verifier can compute on its own) are
factored out into a new term \\(\delta(y, z) \\).

This arrangement will allow us to verify relations between the resulting inner product,
its vectors and the commitments to high-level and low-level [variables](#variables).

The choice of placing \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{O}\\) on the same side with \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}\\) is arbitrary:
the proof would still work if \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{O}\\) was rearranged on the right-hand side instead.

If we reorder terms, we get:

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle
=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle -
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{a}\_L \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_O, \mathbf{a}\_O \rangle
\\]

Merge the statements containing \\(\mathbf{a}\_O \\):

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle
=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L, \mathbf{w}\_L                    \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O    \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_R                    \rangle
\\]

Rearrange \\(\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle\\) into
\\(\langle \mathbf{a}\_L, \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle\\):

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle
=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L, \mathbf{w}\_L                    \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O    \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_R                    \rangle
\\]

Multiply the \\( \langle \mathbf{a}\_R, 
\mathbf{w}\_R \rangle \\) term by \\(\mathbf{y}^n\\) one one side of the inner product and by \\(\mathbf{y}^{-n}\\) on the other side:

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle
=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L,                    \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R    \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L,                    \mathbf{w}\_L                       \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O,                   -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O        \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \rangle
\\]

Merge the statements containing \\(\mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R\\):

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle
=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L,                                       \mathbf{w}\_L                    \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O,                                      -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O     \rangle
\\]

Add \\(\delta(y, z) = \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_L \rangle \\) to both sides:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle +
\delta(y, z)
&=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L,                       \mathbf{w}\_L                \rangle \\\\ 
&+
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O,                      -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_L                \rangle
\end{aligned}
\\]

Merge the terms containing \\(\mathbf{w}\_L\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z)
&= \langle \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, 
\mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R,
\mathbf{w}\_L \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, 
-\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \rangle
\end{aligned}
\\]

Merge the terms containing \\(\mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R\\):

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z) =
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, 
\mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{w}\_L \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, 
-\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \rangle
\\]

We want to combine a sum of two inner products \\(\langle a, b \rangle + \langle c, d \rangle\\) into one inner product.
To do that, we will take a term of a polynomial formed by a linear combination of these products with respect to a challenge scalar \\(x\\). Specifically, the 2nd degree term of \\(\langle a \cdot x + c \cdot x^2, b \cdot x + d \cdot x^0 \rangle\\) is equal to
\\( \langle a, b \rangle + \langle c, d \rangle\\).

To apply this technique to the above equation we assign \\(a, b, c, d\\) the following values:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
a &= \mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \\\\
b &= \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{w}\_L\\\\
c &= \mathbf{a}\_O \\\\
d &= -\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O
\end{aligned}
\\]

Next, we combine \\(a, b, c, d\\) using the equation \\( \langle a \cdot x + c \cdot x^2, b \cdot x + d \cdot x^0 \rangle \\). When we take its second degree, we recover a single inner product, which was our original goal:

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z) = 
\text{2nd degree of }
\langle (\mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R) \cdot x + 
\mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2,
(\mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R +
\mathbf{w}\_L) \cdot x +
(-\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O) \cdot x^0 \rangle 
\\]

Distribute the \\(x\\) values: 

\\[
w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z) = 
\text{2nd degree of }
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + 
\mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2,
\mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x +
\mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x -
\mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \rangle
\\]

This is equivalent to the equation we started with, but has a single
inner product with \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}\\) and \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{O}\\) on the left, \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\) on
the right, and non-secret terms factored out.

Blinding the inner product
--------------------------

In the current form, the vectors in the inner-product reveal information about the values
\\({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}\\), \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\) and \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{O}\\), which in turn reveal the values \\(\mathbf{v}\\).
And since the inner-product argument is not zero-knowledge, the vectors cannot be used in the inner-product argument either.
To solve this problem, the prover chooses two vectors of blinding factors

\\[
{\mathbf{s}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{s}}\_{R} \\;{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; {\mathbb Z\_p}^{n},
\\]

and uses them to blind \\(\mathbf{a}\_L\\) and \\(\mathbf{a}\_R\\) within left and right sides of the inner product respectively.

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a}\_{L} &\leftarrow \mathbf{a}\_{L} + \mathbf{s}\_{L} \cdot x^2 \\\\
\mathbf{a}\_{R} &\leftarrow \mathbf{a}\_{R} + \mathbf{s}\_{R} \cdot x^2
\end{aligned}
\\]

The blinding factors are multiplied by \\(x^2\\) so that when the substitution is made into the \\(\mathbf{l}(x)\\) and \\(\mathbf{r}(x)\\) equations, \\({\mathbf{s}}\_{L}\\) will be in the 3rd degree of \\(x\\) in \\(\mathbf{l}(x)\\), and \\({\mathbf{s}}\_{L}\\) will be in the 3rd degree of \\(x\\) in \\(\mathbf{r}(x)\\). As a result, the blinding factors will not interfere with the value \\(t_2\\), which is the 2nd degree of \\(\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle\\).

Note: multiplication outputs \\(\mathbf{a}\_O\\) do not need their own blinding factors:
they are automatically blinded by \\(\mathbf{s}\_{L}\\) since both \\(\mathbf{a}\_L\\)
and \\(\mathbf{a}\_O\\) are terms in the same (left) side of the inner product.

We now construct vector polynomials \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\),
which represent the left and right sides of the input to the inner-product equation, with these new definitions:
\\[
\begin{aligned}
  {\mathbf{l}}(x) &= (\mathbf{a}\_L + \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^2) \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2 \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{a}\_L \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2 \\\\
  {\mathbf{r}}(x) &= \mathbf{y}^n \circ (\mathbf{a}\_R + \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^2) \cdot x + \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O
\end{aligned}
\\]

When we take the inner product of \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\), we get:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  t(x) &= {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle} \\\\
       &= t\_{1} x + t\_{2} x^{2} + t\_{3} x^{3} + t\_{4} x^{4} + t\_{5} x^{5} + t\_{6} x^{6} \\\\
       &= \sum_{i=1}^{6} t_i x^i
\end{aligned}
\\]

Notice that the second degree of \\(t(x)\\) does not include any blinding factors (because the blinding factors end up in the third or greater degrees of \\(t(x)\\)) and only contains the inner product forms of the initial arithmetic gate statements that we are trying to prove:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
t_2 &= \text{2nd degree of } \langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle
\\\\
&= w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z) \\\\
&=
\langle \mathbf{a}\_L \circ \mathbf{a}\_R, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle -
\langle \mathbf{a}\_O, \mathbf{y}^n \rangle + 
\langle \mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{a}\_L \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle +
\langle \mathbf{w}\_O, \mathbf{a}\_O \rangle +
\delta(y, z)
\end{aligned}
\\]

Proving that \\(t_2\\) is correct
---------------------------------

The prover first forms a commitment to the coefficients of \\(t(x)\\), then convinces the verifier that these commit to the correct \\(t(x)\\) by evaluating the polynomial at a challenge point \\(x\\). This proves that \\(t(x)\\) is correct and follows the following equation:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
t(x) &= \sum\_{i=1}^{6} x^i t\_{i} \\\\
t_2 &= w\_c + \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{v} \rangle + \delta(y, z) \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

We define \\(\mathbf{V}\\) as the vector of Pedersen commitments to \\(\mathbf{v}\\), and \\(T_i\\) as the Pedersen commitment to \\(t_i\\) for \\(i \in [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
V_j &= B \cdot v_j + \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{v}\_j \quad \forall j \in [1, m] \\\\
T_i &= B \cdot t_i + \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{t}\_i \quad \forall i \in [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover forms these commitments, and sends them to the verifier. These commitments are related to each other and to \\(t(x)\\) by the following diagram:

\\[

\end{aligned}
\\]

Notice that the sum of each column is a commitment to the variable in the top row using the blinding factor in the second row. The sum of all of the columns is
\\(t(x) B + {\tilde{t}}(x) {\widetilde{B}}\\), a commitment to the value
of \\(t\\) at the point \\(x\\), using the synthetic blinding factor[^2]:
\\[
  {\tilde{t}}(x) = x^2 \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \tilde{\mathbf{v}} \rangle + \sum\_{i = 1,3,4,5,6} x^i \tilde{t}\_{i}
\\]

To convince the verifier that
\\(t(x) = \delta(y,z) + \sum\_{i=1}^{6} x^i t\_{i}\\), the prover sends
the opening \\(t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x)\\) to the verifier, who uses the
bottom row of the diagram to check consistency:
\\[
  t(x) B + {\tilde{t}}(x) {\widetilde{B}} \stackrel{?}{=} x^2 \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{V} \rangle + x^2 \big(w\_c + \delta(y,z)\big) B + \sum\_{i = 1,3,4,5,6} x^i T\_{i}
\\]

[^2]: The blinding factor is synthetic in the sense that it is
    synthesized from the blinding factors of the other commitments.

Proving that \\(\mathbf{l}(x)\\), \\(\mathbf{r}(x)\\) are correct
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We want to relate \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\) to commitments
to \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}\\), \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\), \\({\mathbf{s}}\_{L}\\), and
\\({\mathbf{s}}\_{R}\\). Since
\\[
{\mathbf{r}}(x) = \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O
\\]
we need commitments to \\({\mathbf{y}}^{n} \circ {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\) and
\\({\mathbf{y}}^{n} \circ {\mathbf{s}}\_{R}\\). However, the prover
must form commitments before receiving the verifier’s challenge \\(y\\),
so they can only commit to \\({\mathbf{a}}\_{R}\\) and \\({\mathbf{s}}\_{R}\\),
requiring the verifier to transmute the prover’s commitment over
\\(
({\mathbf{a}}\_{L},{\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\widetilde{a}})
\\)
into a commitment over
\\(
({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{y}}^{n} \circ {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\widetilde{a}})
\\)
(and similarly for \\({\mathbf{s}}\_{R}\\)).

To do this, notice that
\\[
\begin{aligned}
  \text{commitment over }({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\widetilde{a}})
  &=
  {\langle {\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{G}} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\mathbf{H}} \rangle} + {\widetilde{a}} {\widetilde{B}} \\\\
  &=
  {\langle {\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{G}} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{y}}^{n} \circ {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\mathbf{y}}^{-n} \circ {\mathbf{H}} \rangle} + {\widetilde{a}} {\widetilde{B}},
\end{aligned}
\\]
so that by changing generators to
\\({\mathbf{H}}' = {\mathbf{y}}^{-n} \circ {\mathbf{H}}\\), the point which
is a commitment to
\\(({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\widetilde{a}})\\) with respect to
\\(({\mathbf{G}}, {\mathbf{H}}, {\widetilde{a}})\\) is transmuted into a
commitment to
\\(({\mathbf{a}}\_{L}, {\mathbf{y}}^{n} \circ {\mathbf{a}}\_{R}, {\widetilde{a}})\\)
with respect to \\(({\mathbf{G}}, {\mathbf{H}}', {\widetilde{a}})\\).

We define the following commitments over the components of \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
A_I &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{a} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{a}\_L \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}, \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle \\\\
A_O &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{o} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{a}\_O \rangle \\\\
W_L &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{H} \rangle \\\\
W_R &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{G} \rangle \\\\
W_O &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_O, \mathbf{H} \rangle \\\\
S   &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{s} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{s}\_L \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}, \mathbf{s}\_R \rangle
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover forms these commitments, and sends them to the verifier.

For reference, here are the equations for \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and transmuted \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
                        \mathbf{l}(x)  &= \mathbf{a}\_L \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2 \\\\
  \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{r}(x)  &= \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{1}^n + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_O
\end{aligned}
\\]

To relate the prover’s commitments to
\\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\), we use the following diagram:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{G}} \rangle}      &\quad &= \quad & {\langle {\mathbf{a}}\_L \cdot x, {\mathbf{G}} \rangle}      & \quad &+ \quad & {\langle {\mathbf{a}}\_O \cdot x^2, {\mathbf{G}} \rangle}  & \quad &+ \quad& \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x , \mathbf{G} \rangle                     &\quad &+\quad & \langle \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^3 , \mathbf{G} \rangle \\\\
                                                +      &\quad &  \quad &  +                                                           & \quad &  \quad &  +                                                         & \quad &  \quad& +                                                                                            &\quad & \quad & +   \\\\

                                                +      &\quad &  \quad &  +                                                           & \quad &  \quad &  +                                                         & \quad &  \quad& +                                                                                            &\quad & \quad & +   \\\\
  \tilde{e} \cdot \widetilde{B}                        &\quad &= \quad & \tilde{a} \cdot x \cdot \widetilde{B}                        & \quad &+ \quad & \tilde{o} \cdot x^2 \cdot \widetilde{B}                    & \quad &+ \quad& 0                                                                                            &\quad &+\quad & \tilde{s} \cdot x^3 \cdot \widetilde{B} \\\\
                                    \shortparallel     &\quad &  \quad & \shortparallel                                               & \quad &  \quad & \shortparallel                                             & \quad &  \quad& \shortparallel                                                                               &\quad & \quad & \shortparallel   \\\\
                                                       &\quad &= \quad & x \cdot A_I                                                  & \quad &+ \quad & x^2 \cdot A_O - \langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{H} \rangle     & \quad &+ \quad& W_L \cdot x + W_R \cdot x + W_O                                                              &\quad &+\quad & x^3 \cdot S
\end{aligned}
\\]

We can interpret the rows and columns similarly to the previous diagram:
the sum of each column is a vector Pedersen commitment with left and right halves from the first and second rows respectively
and blinding factor from the third row.
The sum of all of the columns is a vector
Pedersen commitment to \\({\mathbf{l}}(x)\\) and \\({\mathbf{r}}(x)\\) with
synthetic blinding factor \\({\widetilde{e}}\\).

To convince the verifier that
\\(t(x) = {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle}\\), the prover
sends \\({\widetilde{e}}\\) to the verifier, who uses the bottom row
to compute
\\[
\begin{aligned}
  P &= -{\widetilde{e}} {\widetilde{B}} + x \cdot A_I + x^2 \cdot A_O - \langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{H} \rangle + W_L \cdot x + W_R \cdot x + W_O + x^3 \cdot S \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]
if the prover is honest, this is
\\(P = {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{G}} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{r}}(x), {\mathbf{H}}' \rangle}\\),
so the verifier uses \\(P\\) and \\(t(x)\\) as inputs to the [inner product protocol](../notes/index.html#inner-product-proof)
to prove that
\\(t(x) = {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle}\\).


Padding \\(\mathbf{l}(x)\\) and \\(\mathbf{r}(x)\\) for the inner product proof
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above discussion did not have restrictions on the value \\(n\\).
However, the [inner product argument](../notes/index.html#inner-product-proof)
requires the input vectors to have power-of-two elements: \\(n^{+} = 2^k\\).
To resolve this mismatch, we need to specify how to pad vectors \\(\mathbf{l}(x), \mathbf{r}(x)\\)
and related commitments before we can use the inner product argument.

Our goal is to translate the _padding of the constraint system_ into the _padding of proof data_,
so we can keep the constraint system small and perform less computations in proving and verification.

We start by padding the entire constraint system:
multipliers are padded with all-zero assignments \\(a\_{L,j}, a\_{R,j}, a\_{O,j}\\),
all-zero blinding factors \\(s\_{L,j}, s\_{R,j}\\),
and all-zero weights \\(W\_{R,i,j}, W\_{L,i,j}, W\_{O,i,j}\\),
for all constraints \\(i \in [0, q)\\) and all additional multipliers \\(j \in [n,n')\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a}\_L^{+} &= \mathbf{a}\_L \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{a}\_R^{+} &= \mathbf{a}\_R \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{a}\_O^{+} &= \mathbf{a}\_O \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{s}\_L^{+} &= \mathbf{s}\_L \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{s}\_R^{+} &= \mathbf{s}\_R \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{W}\_L^{+} &= \mathbf{W}\_L \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [[0,...,0],...,[0,...,0]] \\\\
\mathbf{W}\_R^{+} &= \mathbf{W}\_R \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [[0,...,0],...,[0,...,0]] \\\\
\mathbf{W}\_O^{+} &= \mathbf{W}\_O \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [[0,...,0],...,[0,...,0]] \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

As a result, the vectors of generators \\(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{H}\\) and challenges \\(\mathbf{y}^n\\) are extended:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{G}^{+}     &= \mathbf{G}   \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [G_n,...,G_{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\mathbf{H}^{+}     &= \mathbf{H}   \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [H_n,...,H_{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\mathbf{y}^{n^{+}} &= \mathbf{y}^n \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The low-level variables are padded with zeroes, so their commitments remain unchanged:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
A_I^{+} &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{a} + \langle \mathbf{G}^{+} , \mathbf{a}\_L^{+} \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}^{+}, \mathbf{a}\_R^{+} \rangle &{}={}& A_I \\\\
A_O^{+} &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{o} + \langle \mathbf{G}^{+} , \mathbf{a}\_O^{+} \rangle                                                     &{}={}& A_O \\\\
S^{+}   &= \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{s} + \langle \mathbf{G}^{+} , \mathbf{s}\_L^{+} \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}^{+}, \mathbf{s}\_R^{+} \rangle &{}={}& S
\end{aligned}
\\]

The flattened weight vectors \\(\mathbf{w}\_{L,R,O}\\) are padded with \\((n^{+} - n)\\) zeroes
because the corresponding weights are padded with zeroes:
\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w}\_L^{+} &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_L^{+}  &{}={}& (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_L) || (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot [0,...,0]) &{}={}& \mathbf{w}\_L || [0,...,0], \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_R^{+} &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_R^{+}  &{}={}& (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_R) || (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot [0,...,0]) &{}={}& \mathbf{w}\_R || [0,...,0], \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_O^{+} &= z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_O^{+}  &{}={}& (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_O) || (z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot [0,...,0]) &{}={}& \mathbf{w}\_O || [0,...,0]. \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The \\(\delta(y,z)\\) remains unchanged because the padding weights are zeroes:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta(y, z)^{+} &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R^{+}, \mathbf{w}\_L^{+} \rangle \\\\
                 &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_L \rangle      +     \langle [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \circ [0,...,0], [0,...,0] \rangle \\\\
                 &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_L \rangle      +     0 \\\\
                 &= \delta(y, z)
\end{aligned}
\\]

Vector polynomials \\(\mathbf{l}(x)\\) is padded with zeroes and \\(\mathbf{r}(x)\\) is padded with additional powers of \\(y\\) in its 0th term:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{l}(x)^{+} &= \mathbf{a}\_L^{+} \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_L^{+} \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R^{+} \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O^{+} \cdot x^2 \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{a}\_L \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2 \\\\
                  &  \hspace{0.5cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \cdot x + [0,...,0] \cdot x^3 + [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \circ [0,...,0] \cdot x + [0,...,0] \cdot x^2 \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{l}(x) || [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{r}(x)^{+} &= \mathbf{y}^{n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{a}\_R^{+} \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^{n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{s}\_R^{+} \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{w}\_L^{+} \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^{n^{+}} + \mathbf{w}\_O^{+} \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \\\\
                  &  \hspace{0.5cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \circ [0,...,0] \cdot x + [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \circ [0,...,0] \cdot x^3 + [0,...,0] \cdot x - [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] + [0,...,0] \\\\
                  &= \mathbf{r}(x) || [-y^n,...,-y^{n^{+}-1}]
\end{aligned}
\\]

The commitments to these vector polynomials are also padded (\\(W\_{L,R,O}\\) remain unchanged because the weights are padded with zeroes):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  P^{+} &= -{\widetilde{e}} {\widetilde{B}} + x \cdot A_I + x^2 \cdot A_O - \langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{H}^{+} \rangle + W_L \cdot x + W_R \cdot x + W_O + x^3 \cdot S \\\\
        &= P - \langle \mathbf{1}, [H_n,...,H_{n^{+}-1}] \rangle
\end{aligned}
\\]

The inner product \\(t(x)\\) remains unchanged because the non-zero padding in the right vector gets multiplied with the zero padding in the left vector:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
t(x)^{+} &= {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x)^{+}, {\mathbf{r}}(x)^{+} \rangle} \\\\
         &= {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle} + {\langle [0,...,0], [-y^n,...,-y^{n^{+}-1}] \rangle} \\\\
         &= {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle} + 0 \\\\
         &= t(x)
\end{aligned}
\\]

This implies that the terms \\(t\_{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\\) also remain unchanged.


Prover’s algorithm
------------------

The protocol begins with the prover computing commitments to the secret values \\(\mathbf{v}\\) and adding all commitments to the protocol transcript.

\\[
V_i \gets \operatorname{Com}(v_i, {\widetilde{v}\_i}) = v\_i \cdot B + {\widetilde{v}\_i} \cdot {\widetilde{B}}
\\] where each \\(\widetilde{v}\_i\\) is sampled randomly.

The prover then [builds constraints](#building-constraints), allocating necessary multiplication gates on the fly,
generating challenge values bound to the commitments \\(V_i\\), filling in weights \\(\mathbf{W}\_L,\mathbf{W}\_R,\mathbf{W}\_O,\mathbf{W}\_V\\), and assigning values to the left, right and output wires
of the multiplication gates (\\(\mathbf{a}\_{L}, \mathbf{a}\_{R}, \mathbf{a}\_{O}\\)).

Once all multiplication wires are assigned, the prover commits to them via vector Pedersen commitments:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{a} \\;&{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; \mathbb Z\_p \\\\
\tilde{o} \\;&{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; \mathbb Z\_p \\\\
A_I          &\gets \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{a} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{a}\_L \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}, \mathbf{a}\_R \rangle \\\\
A_O          &\gets \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{o} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{a}\_O \rangle \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover also computes blinding factors \\(\mathbf{s}\_L, \mathbf{s}\_R\\)
for the left and right multiplication values and commits to them:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}\_{L} \\; &{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; {\mathbb Z\_p}^{n} \\\\
\mathbf{s}\_{R} \\; &{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; {\mathbb Z\_p}^{n} \\\\
\tilde{s} \\;       &{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; \mathbb Z\_p \\\\
S                   &\gets \widetilde{B} \cdot \tilde{s} + \langle \mathbf{G} , \mathbf{s}\_L \rangle + \langle \mathbf{H}, \mathbf{s}\_R \rangle
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover adds \\(A_I\\), \\(A_O\\) and \\(S\\) to the protocol transcript
and obtains challenge scalars \\(y,z \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\) from the transcript.

The prover then flattens the constraints using \\(q\\) powers of challenge \\(z\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w}\_L &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_L, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_R &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_R, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_O &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_O, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_V &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_V,
\end{aligned}
\\]
where each of \\(\mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_O\\) has length \\(n\\) and \\(\mathbf{w}\_V\\) has length \\(m\\).

The prover then constructs the blinded polynomials and their inner product:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  {\mathbf{l}}(x)  &\gets \mathbf{a}\_L \cdot x + \mathbf{s}\_L \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{a}\_O \cdot x^2 \\\\
  {\mathbf{r}}(x)  &\gets \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{a}\_R \cdot x + \mathbf{y}^n \circ \mathbf{s}\_R \cdot x^3 + \mathbf{w}\_L \cdot x - \mathbf{y}^n + \mathbf{w}\_O \\\\
  t(x)             &\gets {\langle {\mathbf{l}}(x), {\mathbf{r}}(x) \rangle}
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover generates blinding factors for terms \\(t\_1, t\_3, t\_4, t\_5, t\_6\\) and creates Pedersen commitments to them
(term \\(t\_0\\) is known to be zero and term \\(t\_2\\) is being proven):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  &\tilde{t}\_1, \tilde{t}\_3, \tilde{t}\_4, \tilde{t}\_5, \tilde{t}\_6 \\;{\xleftarrow{\\$}}\\; \mathbb Z\_p \\\\
  &T_i \gets \operatorname{Com}(t_i, {\tilde{t}\_i}) = t\_i \cdot B + {\tilde{t}\_i} \cdot {\widetilde{B}} \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover adds \\(T_1, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6\\) to the protocol transcript
and obtains a challenge scalar \\(x \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\) from the transcript.

Using the concrete value \\(x\\), the prover computes
the synthetic blinding factors \\({\tilde{t}}(x)\\) and \\(\tilde{e}\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  \tilde{t}\_2    &\gets \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \tilde{\mathbf{v}} \rangle \\\\
  {\tilde{t}}(x)  &\gets \sum\_{i = 1}^{6} x^i \tilde{t}\_{i} \\\\
  {\tilde{e}}     &\gets \tilde{a} \cdot x + \tilde{o} \cdot x^2 + \tilde{s} \cdot x^3 \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The prover adds \\(t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x), {\tilde{e}}\\) to the protocol transcript, obtains a challenge scalar \\(w \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\), and uses it to create a point \\(Q\\):

\\[
	Q \gets  w \cdot B
\\]

The prover evaluates polynomials \\(\mathbf{l}(x), \mathbf{r}(x)\\) and
[pads them to the next power of two](#padding-mathbflx-and-mathbfrx-for-the-inner-product-proof) \\(n \rightarrow n^{+}\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
             n^{+} &= 2^{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil} \\\\
\mathbf{l}^{+}     &= \mathbf{l}(x) \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [0,...,0] \\\\
\mathbf{r}^{+}     &= \mathbf{r}(x) \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [-y^n,...,-y^{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\mathbf{G}^{+}     &= \mathbf{G}    \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [G_n,...,G_{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
{\mathbf{H}'}^{+}  &= \mathbf{H}'   \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} \Big( [y^{-n},...,y^{-(n^{+}-1)}] \circ [H_n,...,H_{n^{+}-1}] \Big) \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

Finally, the prover performs the [inner product argument](../inner_product_proof/index.html) to prove the relation:
\\[
\operatorname{PK}\left\\{
  (\mathbf{G}^{+}, {\mathbf{H}'}^{+} \in {\mathbb G}^{n^{+}}, P', Q \in {\mathbb G}; \mathbf{l}^{+}, \mathbf{r}^{+} \in {\mathbb Z\_p}^{n^{+}})
  : P' = {\langle \mathbf{l}^{+}, \mathbf{G}^{+} \rangle} + {\langle \mathbf{r}^{+}, {\mathbf{H}'}^{+} \rangle} + {\langle \mathbf{l}^{+}, \mathbf{r}^{+} \rangle} Q
\right\\}
\\] where \\({\mathbf{H}'}^{+} = {\mathbf{y}}^{-n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{H}^{+}\\).

The result of the inner product proof is a list of \\(2k\\) points and \\(2\\) scalars, where \\(k = \lceil \log_2(n) \rceil\\): \\(\\{L\_k, R\_k, \\dots, L\_1, R\_1, a, b\\}\\).

The complete proof consists of \\(13+2k\\) 32-byte elements:
\\[
  \\{A\_I, A\_O, S, T\_1, T\_3, T\_4, T\_5, T\_6, t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x), \tilde{e}, L\_k, R\_k, \\dots, L\_1, R\_1, a, b\\}
\\]



Verifier’s algorithm
--------------------

The input to the verifier is the aggregated proof, which contains the \\(m\\) value commitments \\(V_{(j)}\\),
and \\(32 \cdot (13 + 2 k)\\) bytes of the proof data where \\(k = \lceil \log_2(n) \rceil\\) and \\(n\\) is a number of [multiplication gates](#multiplication-gates):

\\[
  \\{A\_I, A\_O, S, T\_1, T\_3, T\_4, T\_5, T\_6, t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x), \tilde{e}, L\_k, R\_k, \\dots, L\_1, R\_1, a, b\\}
\\]

The verifier starts by adding all value commitments \\(V_i\\) to the protocol transcript.

The verifier then [builds constraints](#building-constraints), allocating necessary multiplication gates on the fly and
generating challenge values bound to the commitments \\(V_i\\).

The verifier uses the Fiat-Shamir transform to obtain challenges by adding the appropriate data sequentially to the protocol transcript:

1. \\(A_I, A_O, S\\) are added to obtain challenge scalars \\(y,z \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\),
2. \\(T_1, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6\\) are added to obtain a challenge \\(x \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\),
3. \\(t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x), \tilde{e}\\) are added to obtain a challenge \\(w \in {\mathbb Z\_p}\\).

The verifier flattens constraints:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w}\_L &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_L, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_R &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_R, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_O &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_O, \\\\
\mathbf{w}\_V &\gets z \mathbf{z}^q \cdot \mathbf{W}\_V, \\\\
         w\_c &\gets \langle z \mathbf{z}^q, \mathbf{c} \rangle,
\end{aligned}
\\]
where each of \\(\mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_O\\) has length \\(n\\) and \\(\mathbf{w}\_V\\) has length \\(m\\).

The verifier [pads](#padding-mathbflx-and-mathbfrx-for-the-inner-product-proof) the generators \\(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{H}\\) and challenges \\(\mathbf{y}^n\\) to a power-of-two \\(n^{+}\\):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
             n^{+} &= 2^{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil} \\\\
\mathbf{G}^{+}     &= \mathbf{G}   \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [G_n,...,G_{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\mathbf{H}^{+}     &= \mathbf{H}   \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [H_n,...,H_{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\mathbf{y}^{n^{+}} &= \mathbf{y}^n \hspace{0.1cm} || \hspace{0.1cm} [y^n,...,y^{n^{+}-1}] \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The verifier computes the following scalars for the [inner product argument](../inner_product_proof/index.html):

\\[
	\\{u\_{1}^{2}, \dots, u\_{k}^{2}, u\_{1}^{-2}, \dots, u\_{k}^{-2}, s_0, \dots, s_{n^{+}-1}\\}
\\]

The goal of the verifier is to check two equations.

**First**, verify the second term of the polynomial \\(t(x)\\) (see [notes](#proving-that-t_2-is-correct)):

\\[
\begin{aligned}
t(x) B + {\tilde{t}}(x) {\widetilde{B}}
&\stackrel{?}{=}
x^2 \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{V} \rangle + x^2 \big(w\_c + \delta(y,z)\big) B + \sum\_{i = 1,3,4,5,6} x^i T\_{i},\\\\
\delta(y, z) &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{w}\_L \rangle \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

If we rewrite the check as a comparison with the identity point, we get:
\\[
0 \stackrel{?}{=} x^2 \langle \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{V} \rangle + x^2 \big(w\_c + \delta(y,z)\big) B + \sum\_{i = 1,3,4,5,6} x^i T\_{i} - t(x) B - {\tilde{t}}(x) {\widetilde{B}}
\\]

**Second**, verify the inner product argument for the vectors \\(\mathbf{l}(x), \mathbf{r}(x)\\) that form the \\(t(x)\\) (see [inner-product protocol](../inner_product_proof/index.html#verification-equation))
  
\\[
P' \overset ? = {\langle a \cdot \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{G}^{+} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}}} \circ (b /{\mathbf{s}}), \mathbf{H}^{+} \rangle} + abQ - \sum\_{j=1}^{k} \left( L\_{j} u\_{j}^{2} + u\_{j}^{-2} R\_{j} \right).
\\]

Rewriting as a comparison with the identity point and expanding \\(Q = wB\\) and \\(P' = P^{+} + t(x) wB\\) as [needed for transition to the inner-product protocol](../notes/index.html#inner-product-proof):

\\[
0 \overset ? = P^{+} + t(x) wB - {\langle a \cdot \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{G}^{+} \rangle} - {\langle \mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}} \circ (b /\mathbf{s}), \mathbf{H}^{+} \rangle} - abwB + \sum\_{j=1}^{k} \left( L\_{j} u\_{j}^{2} + u\_{j}^{-2} R\_{j} \right),
\\]
where the [definition](#proving-that-mathbflx-mathbfrx-are-correct) of \\(P^{+}\\) is:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
  P^{+}   = -{\widetilde{e}} {\widetilde{B}} + x \cdot A_I + x^2 \cdot A_O - \langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{H}^{+} \rangle + W_L \cdot x + W_R \cdot x + W_O + x^3 \cdot S
\end{aligned}
\\]
\\[
\begin{aligned}
  W_L &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_L, \mathbf{H} \rangle \\\\
  W_R &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R, \mathbf{G} \rangle \\\\
  W_O &= \langle \mathbf{y}^{-n} \circ \mathbf{w}\_O, \mathbf{H} \rangle \\\\
\end{aligned}
\\]

The verifier combines two equations in one by sampling a random factor \\(r \\; {\xleftarrow{\\$}} \\; {\mathbb Z\_p}\\),
multiplying the first equation by \\(r\\), and adding it with the second equation.

Finally, verifier groups all scalars by each point and performs a single multiscalar multiplication:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
0 \quad \stackrel{?}{=} & \quad x       \cdot A\_I \\\\
                      + & \quad x^2     \cdot A\_O \\\\
                      + & \quad x^3     \cdot S \\\\
                      + & \quad \langle r x^2 \mathbf{w}\_V, \mathbf{V} \rangle \\\\
                      + & \quad \sum\_{i = 1,3,4,5,6} r x^i T\_{i} \\\\
                      + & \quad \Big(w \big(t(x) - ab\big) + r \big(x^2 (w\_c + \delta(y,z)) - t(x)\big) \Big) \cdot B \\\\
                      + & \quad (-{\widetilde{e}} - r{\tilde{t}}(x)) \cdot \widetilde{B} \\\\
                      + & \quad {\langle \big( x \mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}} \circ \mathbf{w}\_R \big) || [0,...,0] - a\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{G}^{+} \rangle}\\\\
                      + & \quad {\langle -\mathbf{1} + \mathbf{y}^{-n^{+}} \circ \big( (x \mathbf{w}\_L + \mathbf{w}\_O) || [0,...,0] - (b /{\mathbf{s}}) \big), \mathbf{H}^{+} \rangle}\\\\
                      + & \quad {\langle [u_{1}^2,    \dots, u_{k}^2    ], [L_1, \dots, L_{k}] \rangle}\\\\
                      + & \quad {\langle [u_{1}^{-2}, \dots, u_{k}^{-2} ], [R_1, \dots, R_{k}] \rangle}
\end{aligned}
\\] where \\(1/{\mathbf{s}}\\) are inverses of \\(\mathbf{s}\\), computed as a [reversed list](../inner_product_proof/index.html#verifiers-algorithm) of \\(\mathbf{s}\\).
